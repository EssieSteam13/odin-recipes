        <h3> Steps </h3>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Butter the bottoms and sides of a 9x13-inch pan. </li>
                        <li> Chop nuts and toss with cinnamon. Set aside. </li>
                        <li> Unroll phyllo dough. Cut whole stack in half to fit pan. Cover phyllo with a dampened cloth to keep 
                             from drying out as you work. Place two sheets of dough in pan, butter thoroughly. Repeat until you 
                             have 8 sheets layered. </li>
                        <li> Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons of nut mixture on top. Top with two sheets of dough, butter, nuts, 
                             layering as you go. The top layer should be about 6 to 8 sheets deep. </li>
                        <li> Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the bottom of the pan. 
                             You may cut into 4 long rows then make diagonal cuts. Bake for about 50 minutes until baklava is 
                             golden and crisp. </li>
                        <li> Make sauce while baklava is baking. Boil sugar and water until sugar is melted. Add vanilla and honey. 
                             Simmer for about 20 minutes. </li>
                        <li> Remove baklava from the oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. Let cool. </li>
                        <li> Serve in cupcake papers. This freezes well. Leave it uncovered as it gets soggy if it is wrapped up. </li>
                        
                    </ol>
