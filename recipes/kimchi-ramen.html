        <h2> Making Kimchi Ramen </h2>

        <p> Kimchi ramen is probably one of <strong>easiest</strong> and most delicious meals that you can make!
            This dish is recommended to be enjoyed with friends, family, and anyone that you wish to make happy memories with.
            I hope to help people introduce new meals to their everyday cooking! Even if it is just a variation of something
            they make all the time, at least it will be healthier. Lol I don't know what the hicken heck I'm talking about. Anyways, onto
            the next papragraph I'm required to write for this assignmet.

        <p> If you're in the mood for something spicy and a kick of sour, this is definitly what the <a href= https://www.dibustock.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Boy-with-a-magnifying-glass-looking-for-something.jpg> <strong> GODDAMN FUCK </strong> <em>your</em> looking for </a>!
            It consists of ramen noodles, kimchi, and any choice of vegtables you would like to accompany it with!
            It takes about 15 minutes to prepare, and an hour to enjoy XD!
            Kimchi ramen is even so simple that you can start to teach your <em>incompetent</em> children how to finally cook for their own <em>mutha fucking</em>selves!
