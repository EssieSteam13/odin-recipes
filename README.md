# odin-recipes
    Hi, my name is Essence! For this Odin Project assignemt I will be creating a website about some of my favorite recipes. To do so I will be utilizing all of the material I have learned thus far such as: 

           1. Creating a repository on GitHub 

           2. Utilizing the basic commands for the command line
                 -as well as Git commands

           3. Creating HTML documents for my website to live on
                 -while also keeping in mind and using basic html elements

           4. Making links using the html element <a> along with attributes

           5. Inserting images using the html element <img> and the src attribute

           6. And most importantly I will be making GOOD Git Commit Messages for future reference

    I will also strive to use my best coding etiquette to be mindful of future maintenance and development done by myself or other developers.
